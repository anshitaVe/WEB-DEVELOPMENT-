********XML*********
markup language based on simple and platform independent rules for processing and displaying textual information in a structured way.

Platform independent nature.

Example: an XML document generated by an application running on Microsoft windows can be easily executed in an application running on Sun Solaris. 

Allows you to share information between different computers, application and organisation without the need of passing through many layers of conversion.

*********XHTML************
for designing Web application.

Combines features of HTML and XML.

XML is used to describe data while HTML is used to display data. 


**************AJAX***************
Uses Javascript and XML as the main technologies for developing interactive web applications.

Application which only uses javascript and XMLHttpRequest object.

It makes the request - response cycle of clients and server fast by updating the parts of the web pages without reloading the whole page.

Works by creating an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object and sending an HttpRequest request. This request passes over the internet to a web server. The server process the HttpRequest request, creates a response, and sends the data back to the Web browser over the Internet. The Web browser processes the received data by using JavaScript and updates the data of the Web page.


****************ASP.NET************

**************PHP****************
Scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages.

Interpreted language executed on the server side.

*************WEB SERVICES**************
Web services, also called application services, are multiplatform application components designed to integrate with a Web application over a network.

This integration is performed using a collection of XML-based standards and protocols, such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) and Representational State Transfer (REST).

 XML is used to describe the Web page data using tags.

SOAP is used to transfer the data over a network.

WSDL is used to describe the available services.

UDDI is a registry that is used to list the available services. 

Web services do not provide any Graphical User Interface (GUI) to users and do not require the use of Web browsers and HTML They help you to integrate applications operating on different network platforms, hardware, software, and databases. They rely on various protocols to exchange the data. These protocols include HTTP, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
